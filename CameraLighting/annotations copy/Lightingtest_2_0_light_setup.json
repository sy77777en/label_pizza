Initially, saturated red light creates a red background and tinted patterns on their faces, producing a warm color tone with balanced brightness. The light then shifts to white, casting silhouettes on the background, neutralizing the color tone, and increasing brightness, before gradually fading into darkness. As the background turns pale, strong directional lighting introduces stylistic shadows, partially obscuring their faces. The scene then transitions to a dark background with minimal light, before a bright white glow returns, restoring visibility."
