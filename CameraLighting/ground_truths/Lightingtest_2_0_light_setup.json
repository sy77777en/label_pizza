The background has predominantly cool hues, with bluish tones in the water and green vegetation. The lighting on the woman appears softer and more even, while the background has a different, cooler tone, creating an inconsistency that suggests the human and background may have been composited together in post-production."

      "Describe the scene and lighting setup": "Two girls stand side by side, illuminated solely by projected light, as the video transitions through distinct color and lighting changes. Initially, saturated red light creates a red background and tinted patterns on their faces, producing a warm color tone with balanced brightness. The light then shifts to white, casting silhouettes on the background, neutralizing the color tone, and increasing brightness, before gradually fading into darkness. As the background turns pale, strong directional lighting introduces stylistic shadows, partially obscuring their faces. The scene then transitions to a dark background with minimal light, before a bright white glow returns, restoring visibility."
