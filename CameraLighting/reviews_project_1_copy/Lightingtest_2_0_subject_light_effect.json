Initially, soft side lighting comes from the left, gently illuminating part of the coil. As the coil discharges, brief flashes of light strike specific spots on its surface, creating localized highlights. Despite these occasional bursts, the overall lighting contrast remains moderate throughout the scene."

Meanwhile, the photographer on the right maintains a consistent normal contrast across his entire body."

When the background light turns off and the beam lights shift to red, the subjects are primarily lit by the beam lights and some top lights, increasing the contrast to above 1:8. Additionally, the moving beam lights create strong highlights on the characters before shifting away, further enhancing the dramatic lighting effects."
