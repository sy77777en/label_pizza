A woman wearing a shiny dress and a furry coat is falling off the sofa, initially taking up 70% of the frame's width, with nearly her entire body visible at the bottom of the frame. As she falls to the floor, the camera tilts downward, revealing her holding a wine bottle in her right hand, with her body visible from the knees up. In the bottom right corner, part of a glass table with bottles is visible, while the hand of another person is visible in the bottom left corner."
