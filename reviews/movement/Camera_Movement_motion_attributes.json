      "How fast is the camera movement? (e.g., crash zoom, whip pan)?": "Regular",
      "What is the camera steadiness?": "Very Smooth / No Shaking (e.g., Drone shot with no shaking at all)",

      "If the camera motion is too complex, how would you describe it?": "The drone smoothly flies above a racing car executing a drift. It tracks the car from behind while moving forward, panning left, and slightly rolling counterclockwise to create a Dutch angle as it positions itself in front of the car. The drone's movement is visually dynamic and pleasing to watch."

      "If the camera motion is too complex, how would you describe it?": "The drone camera continuously follows two motorcyclists from behind in a downward-facing aerial view. It first tilts down to capture one rider making a quick left turn. The shot then shifts into slow motion, during which the camera tilts up slightly to reveal the second motorcyclist. Just before returning to regular speed, it tilts down again to an almost bird\u2019s-eye view. Once back to normal speed, the motorcyclists speed up, moving away from the camera and appearing smaller in the frame. The overall drone movement is complex yet well-executed, making the sequence visually engaging"

During the motion, it rolls counterclockwise, transitioning the camera angle from upside down to upright. Overall, the movement is well-executed and smooth, making it pleasing to watch."

It initially moves forward as the player attempts to walk, but an explosion directly ahead throws the player backward, causing the camera to tilt upward and drop down. Finally, the camera pans from right to left, suggesting the player is trying to stand up, leaning on one arm for support."

      "If the camera motion is too complex, how would you describe it?": "The camera initially  moves downward toward the ground. As the object enlarges in the frame, the camera then shifts from a side view to a front-facing position, moving in a smooth, clockwise motion. This gradual repositioning highlights the subject while maintaining a dynamic sense of movement."
