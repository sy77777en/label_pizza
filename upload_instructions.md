# Label Pizza Setup Guide

## Quick Setup

**For a quick start, use the single command‑line tool:**

```bash
python upload_projects_from_folder.py --folder-path ./example
```

This single command imports everything in the `example/` folder — videos, users, question groups, schemas, projects, and even sample annotations — so you get a fully‑working demo in seconds. If you just want to see Label Pizza in action, run it and explore the UI. When you’re ready to tailor the workflow to your own data, continue with the rest of this guide to learn how to batch‑upload users, videos, question groups, schemas, and projects.

---

The rest of this README explains the detailed folder structure, JSON formats, and step‑by‑step process for anyone who wants to learn how to batch‑upload their own projects.

## Folder Structure

> This directory provides a compact, end‑to‑end example of the files required to set up a video‑annotation workflow. Copy whichever pieces you already have, adjust the JSON to match your questions and videos, and import them with the project‑creation scripts. Any missing parts (e.g., annotations or reviews) can always be added later through the web interface.

## Folder Structure / JSON Format

### `videos.json`

Contains one entry per video.

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/syCen/example4labelpizza/resolve/main/human.mp4",
    "metadata": {
      "original_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3wKzyIN1yk",
      "license": "Standard YouTube License"
    }
  },
  {
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/syCen/example4labelpizza/resolve/main/pizza.mp4",
    "metadata": {
      "original_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J1NzjA9jNg",
      "license": "Standard YouTube License"
    }
  }
]
```

The **`url`** must point straight to the video file itself, and the link must end with the actual filename like `my_clip.mp4`. Everything inside **`metadata`** is kept as-is for provenance. We recommend hosting services such as Hugging Face Datasets or S3 buckets for video files.

### `question_groups/`

Each JSON file defines *one* group of related questions.

Below is an example question group that asks annotators to report how many people appear in a video and, if any, to describe them.

```json
{
    "title": "Human",
    "description": "Detect and describe all humans in the video.",
    "is_reusable": false,
    "is_auto_submit": false,
    "verification_function": "check_human_description",
    "questions": [
        {
            "qtype": "single",
            "text": "Number of people?",
            "display_text": "Number of people?",
            "options": [
                "0",
                "1",
                "2",
                "3 or more"
            ],
            "display_values": [
                "0",
                "1",
                "2",
                "3 or more"
            ],
            "option_weights": [
                1.0,
                1.0,
                1.0,
                1.0
            ],
            "default_option": "0"
        },
        {
            "qtype": "description",
            "text": "If there are people, describe them.",
            "display_text": "If there are people, describe them."
        }
    ]
}
```

* **`text`** and **`options`** are immutable identifiers, whereas **`display_text`** and **`display_values`** can later be edited in the web UI for wording tweaks.
* **`option_weights`** let you assign extra influence to certain answers in the weighted majority vote (for reviewer to resolve annotator disagreement), in case you need one option to carry more weight than the others.
* **`default_option`** pre‑selects a choice when the task opens for both annotators and reviewers.
* **`is_reusable`** indicates whether this question group can be added to multiple schemas.
* **`is_auto_submit`** automatically submits the default answer as soon as the video loads. For example, if 99 % of your clips are safe, auto‑submitting "No" to an NSFW question saves annotators from repeatedly clicking the obvious answer.
* Current `qtype` values are `single` (single‑choice) and `description` (free‑text).

### `schemas.json`

A schema is a set of question groups.

```json
[
  {
    "schema_name": "Questions about Humans",
    "question_group_names": [
      "Human", "NSFW"
    ]
  },
  {
    "schema_name": "Questions about Pizzas",
    "question_group_names": [
      "Pizza", "NSFW"
    ]
  }
]
```

### `users.json`

Lists the user accounts that should exist before projects are created. `user_type` can be `admin`, `human`, or `model`.

```json
[
    {
        "user_id": "Admin 1",
        "email": "admin1@example.com",
        "password": "admin111",
        "user_type": "admin"
    },
    {
        "user_id": "User 1",
        "email": "user1@example.com",
        "password": "user111",
        "user_type": "human"
    }
]
```

### `projects.json`

A project applies a schema to a collection of videos.

```json
[
  {
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "schema_name": "Questions about Humans",
    "videos": [
      "human.mp4",
      "pizza.mp4"
    ]
  },
  {
    "project_name": "Pizza Test 0",
    "schema_name": "Questions about Pizzas",
    "videos": [
      "human.mp4",
      "pizza.mp4"
    ]
  }
]
```

### `assignments.json`

Grants a **role** (`annotator`, `reviewer`, `admin`, or `model`) to a user within a project. Admins gain project access automatically, and once a user is created as `model` they cannot be switched to a human role (or vice‑versa) because model accounts store confidence scores.

```json
[
  {
    "user_email": "user1@example.com",
    "project_name": "Pizza Test 0",
    "role": "annotator"
  },
  {
    "user_email": "user1@example.com",
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "role": "annotator"
  }
]
```

### `annotations/` and `reviews/`

Both directories share the same JSON structure: each file contains answers for a single question group across all projects and videos. Use `annotations/` for annotator answers and `reviews/` for reviewer ground truth (there can be only one ground‑truth answer per video‑question‑group pair).

#### Annotations folder structure:

* `annotations/humans.json` - Contains all human‑related annotations
* `annotations/pizzas.json` - Contains all pizza‑related annotations
* `annotations/nsfw.json`  - Contains all NSFW‑related annotations

**Example `annotations/humans.json`:**

```json
[
  {
    "question_group_title": "Human",
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "user_name": "User 1",
    "video_uid": "human.mp4",
    "answers": {
      "Number of people?": "1",
      "If there are people, describe them.": "The person appears to be a large man with a full beard and closely cropped hair."
    },
    "is_ground_truth": false
  },
  {
    "question_group_title": "Human",
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "user_name": "User 1",
    "video_uid": "pizza.mp4",
    "answers": {
      "Number of people?": "0",
      "If there are people, describe them.": ""
    },
    "is_ground_truth": false
  }
]
```

#### Reviews folder structure:

* `reviews/humans.json` - Contains all human‑related ground‑truth reviews
* `reviews/pizzas.json` - Contains all pizza‑related ground‑truth reviews
* `reviews/nsfw.json`   - Contains all NSFW‑related ground‑truth reviews

**Example `reviews/humans.json`:**

```json
[
  {
    "question_group_title": "Human",
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "user_name": "Admin 1",
    "video_uid": "human.mp4",
    "answers": {
      "Number of people?": "1",
      "If there are people, describe them.": "The person appears to be a large man with a full beard and closely cropped hair."
    },
    "is_ground_truth": true
  },
  {
    "question_group_title": "Human",
    "project_name": "Human Test 0",
    "user_name": "Admin 1",
    "video_uid": "pizza.mp4",
    "answers": {
      "Number of people?": "0",
      "If there are people, describe them.": ""
    },
    "is_ground_truth": true
  }
]
```

**Important:** The `is_ground_truth: true` field marks reviewer ground‑truth answers and should appear at most once per (video, question group) pair.

## Step‑by‑Step Upload Guide

Follow the steps **in order** so that every dependency (videos → question groups → schemas → users → projects → assignments → annotations) is satisfied.

### Step 0: Initialize Database

**Important:** Initialize the database before running any other steps.

```python
from label_pizza.db import init_database
init_database("DBURL")  # replace with your database URL
```

### Step 1: Upload Videos

Upload all the videos defined in `videos.json`.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import upload_videos

upload_videos(videos_path="./example/videos.json")
```

### Step 2: Register Question Groups and Schemas

Load the question groups and schemas from the `question_groups/` folder and `schemas.json`.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import create_schemas

create_schemas(
    schemas_path="./example/schemas.json",
    question_groups_folder="./example/question_groups"
)
```

### Step 3: Upload Users

Create the user accounts listed in `users.json`.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import upload_users

upload_users(users_path="./example/users.json")
```

### Step 4: Create Projects

Generate projects from `projects.json`.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import create_projects

create_projects(projects_path="./example/projects.json")
```

### Step 5: Assign Users to Projects

Assign roles to users as specified in `assignments.json`.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import bulk_assign_users

bulk_assign_users(assignment_path="./example/assignments.json")
```

### Step 6: Upload Annotations and Reviews

Finally, upload any pre‑existing annotations and reviewer ground truth.

```python
from label_pizza.upload_utils import upload_annotations, upload_reviews

upload_annotations(annotations_folder="./example/annotations")
upload_reviews(reviews_folder="./example/reviews")
```
